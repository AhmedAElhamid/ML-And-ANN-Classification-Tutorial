# ML And ANN Classification Tutorial
 
## Introduction
This tutorial uses many classifiers to compare between their accuracy, percision and recall on the adult dataset

## Dataset

Link : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult
Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database. A set of reasonably clean records was extracted using 
the following conditions: ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1)&& (HRSWK>0))
Prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year.


## techniques used

- Scaling
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Grid Search

## Classification Models

1. Machine Learning Models
- KNN
- Logistic Regression
- SVC (RBF Kernel,Poly Kernel)
- DecisionTreeClassifier
- Naive Bayes (Bernoulli, Multinomial, Gaussian)

2. Ensemble  Learning
- Voting hard
- Bagging
- Random forest
- AdaBoost
- Gradient Tree Boosting
- XGBoost

3. Artificial Nerual Network (ANN)
